Description:
    Generates category for component and page layouts.

Example:
    rails generate forms input_groups
        Where:
            'forms' is the name of the main wrapper.
            'input_groups' is the name of the category.

    This will create:
        - A 'Input groups' category that will be linked to 'Forms' wrapper.
        - A 'input_groups' folder within the 'app/components/' directory or a folder within the 'app/pages/' directory.
          The location is based on the 'parent wrapper', in this case, the 'forms'.
